Code Commit
Developers commit code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).


Jenkins Build
Jenkins is triggered to build the Java application using Maven.

Runs: mvn clean install
Executes unit tests and generates artifacts.



Code Analysis
SonarQube performs static code analysis to detect:

Code quality issues
Bugs
Security vulnerabilities
Technical debt



Security Scan
AppScan (or similar tool) scans the application for security vulnerabilities.

Can be integrated via CLI or API
Produces a security report



Build & Push Docker Image
Jenkins builds a Docker image of the application and pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).


Update Kubernetes Manifests (GitOps)
Jenkins updates the image tag in the Kubernetes deployment manifest stored in a GitOps repository.


Continuous Deployment via Argo CD
Argo CD watches the GitOps repository and automatically syncs changes to the development environment in the Kubernetes cluster.


Promote to Production
Once validated in dev, the application is manually promoted to the production environment using Argo CD.
