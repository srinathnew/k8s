DevOps focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback, whereas traditional IT operations follow a siloed approach with manual deployments and slow release cycles.

9. What are the key metrics for CI/CD performance?
Answer:

Lead Time: Time from commit to deployment.
Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): Time to recover from failures.

 What is trunk-based development, and how does it impact CI/CD?
Answer:
Trunk-based development means developers commit directly to the main branch (trunk) instead of using long-lived feature branches.

Pros:
Faster CI/CD cycles with fewer merge conflicts.
Reduces integration complexity.
Cons:
Requires strict automated testing to prevent breaking changes.
Example workflow:
Commit to main → Automated Tests → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production.
